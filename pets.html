                        <p>Nellie is a Great Dane that we took in and rescued. She's an old lady (around 7-8 years old), a harlequin, and very lazy but very sweet. She loves car rides, but likes her spot on the couch even more. She is the master of the judgemental side-eye...</p>

                        <img src="images/mama.jpeg" id="pet" style="aspect-ratio: 4:5;" alt="An older tuxedo cat bows her head, staring at a toy">
                        <p>Mama Cat is a stray that randomly showed up with 2 kittens, Pippin and Turnip. She's a tuxedo and bullies the other cats, but is very sweet with people. She also likes to get into trash...we call her a trash gremlin.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h2>Pippin</h2>

                        <img src="images/pip.jpg" id="pet" style="aspect-ratio: 4:5;" alt="A young male tuxedo cat side-eyes the camera">
                        <p>Pippin is a tuxedo cat. He's very sweet and very talkative, but he also likes to hit the other cats on occassion. We originally thought he'd be a good mouser, but the most he's ever caught was a slug. He was very proud of that slug.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h2>Turnip</h2>

                        <p>Turnip is also a tuxedo (we've got a pattern, here), but is a lot quieter than Pippin (except with me...he loves to yell at me). He's very sweet but also very shy, and also hunts the most out of all the cats when given the opportunity. He loves his red flower collar, it's the only one I have ever been able to get him to keep on. He also has a habbit of befriending random strays that come by the house, somehow.</p>

                        <h2>Binx</h2>

                        <p>Binx is one of my black cats. She's sweet with me, but will not hesitate to hit the others if she gets annoyed at them. She loves to sit on my shoulders, and when she was younger and learning how walk/climb would use me for practice. I got scratched a lot at first, but it was worth it in the end.</p>

                        <h2>Angel</h2>
                        <h5>Cat #5</h5>
                        <img src="images/ang.jpg" id="pet" style="aspect-ratio: 4:5;" alt="A gray cat eats her food, ignoring the camera">
                        <p>Angel was from the same litter as binx, and is one of my gray cats! She's also a sweeheart, and also loves to yell at me when she wants something. She sounds like she has a southern twang when she meows, though it was more prominent when she was a kitten. She likes to sit in my car with me and chill out on occassion.</p>

                        <h2>Rugrat</h2>
                        <h5>Cat #6</h5>
                        <img src="images/rug2.jpeg" id="pet" style="aspect-ratio: 4:5;" alt="A young tuxedo kitten rolls around on her back, wanting attention">
                        <p>Rugrat is another sweet tuxedo of mine, and the oldest of the (final) litter we've (I've) taken in. She's shy and doesn't like being held much, but she does like to sit in my lap and likes to sit in my car with me as well. She isn't very vocal, but does love to play!</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h2>Scout</h2>
                        <h5>Cat #7</h5>
                        <img src="images/scout.jpeg" id="pet" style="aspect-ratio: 4:5;" alt="A young gray kitten is held by his owner, looking away from the camera">
                        <p>Scout is the other gray cat I've got. He's part Rugrat and Gremlin's litter, and is vey clingy and very needy. He thrives on attention, and will yell and paw at you to get it. He's also more social than the other cats, save for Mama, and is more likely to let a stranger pet or approach him than the others. He also likes his car time, especially when the heater is on and he can lay right on it.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h2>Gremlin</h2>
                        <h5>Cat #8</h5>
                        <img src="images/grem.jpg" id="pet" style="aspect-ratio: 4:5;" alt="A black cat stares unamused at the camera as he drinks some water">
                        <p>Gremlin is the youngest, and my other black cat. He was born 2 days after Rugrat and Scout, a miracle really since there were two stillborns that were born before him. He isn't vocal and only tolerates being picked up, but he does love cuddles and pets still. He also likes to chill in my car, and is a very big and fluffy baby.</p>
